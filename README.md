# Todo-list ✏️

A classic To-do list app. This is a practice project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-todo-list). Its main goal is to put into practice some learned concepts throughout the curriculum up to this point - specifically ES6, webpack, factories and object constructors.
